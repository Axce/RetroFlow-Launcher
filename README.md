<p>Display and launch your games and homebrews in style.<br /><strong>HexFlow Launcher</strong> features a 3d user interface to display your games with their box art and supports many customization options like custom covers, backgrounds, and - in v0.6 and above - one custom category.</p>
<p>Launching a game/app from <strong>HexFlow Launcher</strong> will close the launcher automaticaly without asking.</p>
<h2>Custom Covers</h2>
<p>Place your custom covers in "<em>ux0:/data/HexFlow/COVERS/PSVITA/</em>"</p>
<p>Cover images must be in <strong>png</strong> format and the file name must match the <strong>App ID</strong> or the <strong>App Name</strong> of each app (recomended resolution 256x256px). In v0.9 and above, games in the PS1 category can have cover png's named to match the <strong>App ID</strong>, or the <strong>App Name</strong>, or the <strong>PSX Serial</strong> as found in the triangle menu. <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/7176/6885249717_738e8ee187_n.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sample vita cover image</a></p>
<h3>Download Covers and Backgrounds</h3>
<p>In v0.3 and above, covers can be downloaded automatically from the settings menu (Start button). You can also download covers and backgrounds manually from the link below. A big thanks to <b>astuermer</b> for his contribution.</p>
<p><s><a href="https://github.com/andiweli/hexflow-covers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/andiweli/hexflow-covers</a></s> (v0.9.1 and below)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jimbob4000/hexflow-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jimbob4000/hexflow-covers/</a> (v1.0 and above)</p>
<h3>Custom Background</h3>
<p>Place your <strong>Background.png</strong> or <strong>Background.jpg</strong> image in "<em>ux0:/data/HexFlow/</em>" (recomended resolution 1280x720px or less). Some custom backgrounds are available <a href="https://github.com/andiweli/hexflow-covers/tree/main/Backgrounds">HERE</a>. In v0.9 and above, these sample custom backgrounds are included by default.</p>
<h3>Custom Category</h3>
<p>In v0.6 and above, take the <strong>applist.dat</strong> file in "<em>ux0:data/HexFlow/</em>" and rename it to <strong>customsort.dat</strong>. This will generate a 5th category - "Custom" - and you can put what games you want or reorder it within Vitashell, or on your PC in a unix-compatible text editor such as gVim Easy. Windows notepad won't work.</p>
<h3>Custom Music</h3>
<p>Place your  <strong>Music.ogg</strong> or <strong>Music.mp3</strong> file in "<em>ux0:data/HexFlow/</em>" (music will play automaticaly when the "Sounds" option is enabled)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>AutoBoot</h2>
<p>If you want to auto-launch <strong>HexFlow Launcher</strong> every time your PS Vita boots up you can use the <a href="https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/#/info/261" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AutoBoot</strong></a> plugin by Rinnegatamante.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/Media/screen_01.jpg" width="800" title="screen-01"></p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>Navigate your library using the <strong>DPad</strong> or the <strong>Left Stick</strong> or with the <strong>Touch Screen</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>R/L triggers</strong>: Skip 5 items</p>
<p><strong>Select+R/L triggers</strong>: Skip by alphabet</p>
<p><strong>Cross</strong>: Select/Launch game/app</p>
<p><strong>Square</strong>: Change Category</p>
<p><strong>Triangle</strong>: Game Details</p>
<p><strong>Circle</strong>: Change View/Cancel</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong>: Settings menu</p>
<p><strong>DPad Up/Down</strong>: Access SwitchView UI menu</p>
<p><strong>In v1.0 and above, DPad Up/Down can either be used to access SwitchView UI menu, or to change category if either of these options are enabled in the Settings menu</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
<p>For PSP bubbles generated by Adrenaline Bubbles Manager you must set the value of <strong>BubbleID</strong> to <strong>TitleID</strong> in the settings menu of ABM tool. In v0.9 and above, PS1 Bubble ID doesn't matter because it's scanned in binary during the startup.</p>
<p><strong>Subfolders and psp categories plugin are not supported</strong>.</p>

<h2>User Feature Requests</h2>
<p>Feature requests and "issues" posted on Retroflow & HexFlow Launcher are considered for being added to this list. Mostly no feature is impossible because there are experienced coders involved in the HexLauncher Custom project, but this entire project is just for me (only posted publicly out of the "generousity of my heart") so only features that I like will get added.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try coding up a feature (which may be faster than having me do it), then take your editted sourcecode and name it to "index.lua" and put it in like this: ux0:/app/HXLC00001/index.lua</p>
<p>...Or put it directly into the vpk (openable with Winrar) to replace the index.lua there.</p>
<p>The great feature of lua files is they can open in a simple text editor such as Notepad, and you don't need VitaSDK.</p>
<p>If your version works out, send it here as a github "pull request" and I'll see about adding your feature to this project so it can stay as the app updates. Otherwise you'll basicly have to wait for next release and hope I added a feature you want.<p>
<h3>Known bugs</h3>
<p>⚫It freezes/crashes every now and then, but it doesn't seem to happen while "sounds" are set to "Off". ✔️Fix coming in v1.1 - it was an "Out of Memory"-type crash related to the uncompressed audio.</p>
<p>^All the above bugs are also present in VitaHEX's HexFlow Launcher 0.5</p>
<p>⚫Suspending sometimes causes a crash if you're using music.</p>
<p>⚫New glitch in v1 and above: hitting "download all PSP covers" doesn't seem to work due to a typo in the code cleanup of v1.0, but all single downloads work fine.</p>
<p>⚫Due to how the coding of the massive performance boost of v1.0.0+ is, some apps sometimes add garbage to the app title. A double scan on non-alphanumeric app titles might be able to fix this, or a better renaming function might work as a hotfix.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Planned Features for Upcoming Updates</h3>
<p>⚫Rolling cache (costs ~0.5s startup time) ✔️Done, coming in v1.1</p>
<p>⚫Optimized Fonts for even faster startup and even better performance. (saves ~0.5s startup time) ✔️Done, coming in v1.1</p>
<p>⚫RetroFlow ✔️Done, coming in v1.1</p>
<p>⚫RetroFlow: option to combine "PCE-type categories" - PCE, PCECD, TG16, TGCD ✔️Done, coming in v1.1</p>
<p>⚫RetroFlow: option to combine "Gameboy-type categories" - GBA, GBC, GB ✔️Done, coming in v1.1</p>
<p>⚫RetroFlow: option to combine "Arcade Machine-type categories" - FBA, MAME2000, MAME2003, NeoGeo ✔️Done, coming in v1.1</p>
<p>⚫Categories: Dreamcast ("Flycast")✔️Done, coming in v1.1</p>
<p>⚫Categories: Nintendo DS ✔️Done, hidden feature in upcoming v1.1</p>
<p>⚫Easier way to rename games</p>
<p>⚫RetroFlow: "MD5/CDC32 ROM scraping" so you don't have to rename ROM's?</p>
<p>⚫RetroFlow: change ROM directory - as in Retroflow v4.0.0+ (low priority)</p>
<p>⚫Ability to use Adrenaline Bubble Manager, Adrenaline Launcher, and Retroarch for PSP/PS1 where possible, all at once if you so feel like it. ✔️ framework for this - "pspemu_translation_table" is included in v0.9+ but Adrenaline Launcher capabilities are not added yet, only this framework.</p>
<p>⚫Categories: Android ("YoYo Loader")</p>
<p>⚫Categories: RPGMaker XP ("MKXP") ASAP.</p>
<p>⚫Categories: RPGMaker 2000/2003 ("EasyRPG" - low priority)</p>
<p>⚫Categories: Pico8 (low priority, easy to program)</p>
<p>⚫Categories: ScummVM (low priority)</p>
<p>⚫Categories: Playstation Mobile (low priority)</p>
<p>⚫Categories: remote play category (low priority)</p>
<p>⚫Categories: recently played</p>
<p>⚫Categories: most played (maybe)</p>
<p>⚫Categories: favorites</p>
<p>⚫Either new setting "Jump to last played game on startup: ON/OFF" or new startup category: "ALL - *JUMP TO LAST PLAYED*" ✔️Done, trying to decide which of the two ways it should be implemented. This will probably also be released alongside "Recently Played".</p>
<p>⚫"Pro Triangle Menu": add all these settings to the triangle menu: Open a game's trophies (via trophy app URI call), Open a game's manual (not sure how to code this), send game save data to a PSTV, set individual app overclock via PSVShell and the "L..." overclocking program profile writer. AKA the ability to launch an app at 500 overclock through triangle menu. ✔️Only the overclocker is done but the others are planned to come with it if possible. Coming to the public release when Retroflow integration is added to public HexLauncher Custom release</p>
<p>⚫Select opens up a sidebar similar to Vitashell's triangle menu, it will have "search" and little checkboxes to only show games of a certain genre ex: "Puzzles" and "Mario", with "Mario Picross" being in both. Inspired by "Dig - Emulator Front-End" for android. </p>
<p>⚫Absolute full translation for everything, including msg boxes (like retroflow)(easy but low priority)</p>
<p>⚫RetroFlow: option to automatically colorize Game Boy (non-color) games that were officially retroactively given color when played on a GameBoy Color such as Super Mario Land, Super Mario Land 2, QIX, Hyper Lode Runner, DrMario, Metroid 2, etc)(low priority and this will be hard to program).</p>
<p>⚫Extra smooth cover size adjusting, like the XBox "Aurora" coverflow app, you can see it at about 9 minute, 15 seconds into this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqvruf8q3J0 ✔️ There is a janky unreleased implementation of this, but it will probably be scrapped in favor of stealing the smooth scroll code from WiiFlow.</p>
<p>⚫Launchbox view, TN-X view, Wii view, and "List View" with a list of text of game names and maybe 1 cover?</p>
<p>⚫"Advanced options" button at the bottom so start menu can fit more settings? ...or just a RetroFlow style multi-tier settings menu?</p>
<p>⚫Setting for "livearea replacement mode: enables a loading screen image similar to the Enso "Molecule" image. Maybe have it set up autoboot for you, too? This will only be added if "advanced options" button is added. (easy)</p>
<p>⚫Setting to cycle and/or shuffle background musics as in RetroFlow v4.0.1+</p>
<p>⚫Setting to change the category text color (on the top left of the screen) for when you're using a bright background (low priority)</p>
<p>⚫Setting to let you use the touchscreen to touch the "X Launch" on the bottom right of the screen to launch a game starting 1 second after you start HexLauncher Custom. (low priority). Any other touch features probably won't be added because when the screen gets wet it touches random places for you and also because I'm a lazy.</p>
<p>⚫Cover downloads for homebrew, ex: CoolFiverIsABabe's homebrew cover archive. They might have to override to Vita if a cover is found, in order to look right.</p>
<p>⚫The ability to quickly add an app to "Custom" (through triangle menu?). High priority if "rolling refresh" is added.</p>
<p>❌video/media category. Seems like an over-reach, just use MVPlayer.</p>
<p>❌uninstalling or otherwise altering any games (such as in OneMenu). It might mess up someone's Vita.</p>
