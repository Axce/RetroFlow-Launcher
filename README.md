# RetroFlow FAQ's

#### Can I use HexFlow too?
Yes; RetroFlow is seperate, it uses different folders and a different title ID.

#### Do I need to create bubbles for retro games?
No; RetroFlow doesn't need bubbles for retro games provided you have installed re-Patch reloaded and the two DaedalusX64 and RetroArch launcher VPK's.

#### How should I name my games so covers are found?
It's recommended that your roms are named using the no-intro file naming convention, e.g. "Game Name (USA)" , these names are used to match with cover art.

#### How many games can I add?
Only add your favourite games.

RetroFlow isn't optimised for large collections of games, it's recommended that you only add you favourite retro games, adding too many games will result in longer load times.

#### Some systems aren't showing?
Empty collections are hidden by default, once you add some games into the roms folder, they will appear.

#### Can I change the Mega Drive name to Genesis?
Sure; changing your language to 'English - American' will change the 'Mega Drive' name and logo to 'Genesis'.

#### Can I change a core for RetroArch?
The cores have been set by system and cannot be changed on a game-by-game basis at the moment.

To change the core for an entire system, search for "Retroarch Cores" in the file below and edit accordingly.

    ux0:/app/RETROFLOW/index.lua


#### Can I change the rom folder locations?
The locations have been setup to keep things simple, if you would like to change the locations, search for "ROM Folders" in the file below and edit accordingly.

    ux0:/app/RETROFLOW/index.lua



# Adding PSP and Playstation games

These games require bubbles to be made in order to work.

For PSP or PS1 bubbles generated by Adrenaline Bubbles Manager you must set the value of **BubbleID** to **TitleID** in the settings menu of ABM tool.
