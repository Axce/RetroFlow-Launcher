<p>Display and launch your games and homebrews in style.<br /><strong>HexFlow Launcher</strong> features a 3d user interface to display your games with their box art and supports many customization options like custom covers, backgrounds, and - in v0.6 and above - one custom category.</p>
<p>Launching a game/app from <strong>HexFlow Launcher</strong> will close the launcher automaticaly without asking.</p>
<h2>Custom Covers</h2>
<p>Place your custom covers in "<em>ux0:/data/HexFlow/COVERS/PSVITA/</em>"</p>
<p>Cover images must be in <strong>png</strong> format and the file name must match the <strong>App ID</strong> or the <strong>App Name</strong> of each app (recomended resolution 256x256px). In v0.9 and above, games in the PS1 category can have cover png's named to match the <strong>App ID</strong>, or the <strong>App Name</strong>, or the <strong>PSX Serial</strong> as found in the triangle menu. <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/7176/6885249717_738e8ee187_n.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sample vita cover image</a></p>
<h3>Download Covers and Backgrounds</h3>
<p>In v0.3 and above, covers can be downloaded automatically from the settings menu (Start button). You can also download covers and backgrounds manually from the link below. A big thanks to <b>astuermer</b> for his contribution.</p>
<p><s><a href="https://github.com/andiweli/hexflow-covers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/andiweli/hexflow-covers</a></s> (v0.9.1 and below)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jimbob4000/hexflow-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jimbob4000/hexflow-covers/</a> (v1.0 and above)</p>
<h3>Custom Background</h3>
<p>Place your <strong>Background.png</strong> or <strong>Background.jpg</strong> image in "<em>ux0:/data/HexFlow/</em>" (recomended resolution 1280x720px or less). Some custom backgrounds are available <a href="https://github.com/andiweli/hexflow-covers/tree/main/Backgrounds">HERE</a>. In v0.9 and above, these sample custom backgrounds are included by default.</p>
<h3>Custom Category</h3>
<p>In v0.6 and above, take the <strong>applist.dat</strong> file in "<em>ux0:data/HexFlow/</em>" and rename it to <strong>customsort.dat</strong>. This will generate a 5th category - "Custom" - and you can put what games you want or reorder it within Vitashell, or on your PC in a unix-compatible text editor such as gVim Easy. Windows notepad won't work.</p>
<h3>Custom Music</h3>
<p>Place your  <strong>Music.ogg</strong> or <strong>Music.mp3</strong> file in "<em>ux0:data/HexFlow/</em>" (music will play automaticaly when the "Sounds" option is enabled)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>AutoBoot</h2>
<p>If you want to auto-launch <strong>HexFlow Launcher</strong> every time your PS Vita boots up you can use the <a href="https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/#/info/261" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AutoBoot</strong></a> plugin by Rinnegatamante.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/Media/screen_01.jpg" width="800" title="screen-01"></p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>Navigate your library using the <strong>DPad</strong> or the <strong>Left Stick</strong> or with the <strong>Touch Screen</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>R/L triggers</strong>: Skip 5 items</p>
<p><strong>Select+R/L triggers</strong>: Skip by alphabet</p>
<p><strong>Cross</strong>: Select/Launch game/app</p>
<p><strong>Square</strong>: Change Category</p>
<p><strong>Triangle</strong>: Game Details</p>
<p><strong>Circle</strong>: Change View/Cancel</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong>: Settings menu</p>
<p><strong>DPad Up/Down</strong>: Access SwitchView UI menu</p>
<p><strong>In v1.0 and above, DPad Up/Down can either be used to access SwitchView UI menu, or to change category if either of these options are enabled in the Settings menu</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
<p>For PSP bubbles generated by Adrenaline Bubbles Manager you must set the value of <strong>BubbleID</strong> to <strong>TitleID</strong> in the settings menu of ABM tool. In v0.9 and above, PS1 Bubble ID doesn't matter because it's scanned in binary during the startup.</p>
<p><strong>Subfolders and psp categories plugin are not supported</strong>.</p>

<h2>User Feature Requests</h2>
<p>Feature requests and "issues" posted on Retroflow & HexFlow Launcher are considered for being added to this list. Mostly no feature is impossible because there are experienced coders involved in the HexLauncher Custom project, but this entire project is just for me (only posted publicly out of the "generousity of my heart") so only features that I like will get added.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try coding up a feature (which may be faster than having me do it), then take your editted sourcecode and name it to "index.lua" and put it in like this: ux0:/app/HXLC00001/index.lua</p>
<p>...Or put it directly into the vpk (openable with Winrar) to replace the index.lua there.</p>
<p>The great feature of lua files is they can open in a simple text editor such as Notepad, and you don't need VitaSDK.</p>
<p>If your version works out, send it here as a github "pull request" and I'll see about adding your feature to this project so it can stay as the app updates. Otherwise you'll basicly have to wait for next release and hope I added a feature you want.<p>
<h3>Known bugs</h3>
<p>⚫It freezes/crashes every now and then, but it doesn't seem to happen while "sounds" are set to "Off". ✔️This is caused by the sound files taking up too much RAM. A low-RAM sound file has been developed that 100% makes the app never crash (though freezes still do rarely occur), but it doesn't sound quite the same and a more same version is being worked on. In tests, Retroflow's click2.ogg only reduced crashing by around 10%.</p>
<p>^All the above bugs are also present in VitaHEX's HexFlow Launcher 0.5</p>
<p>⚫Suspending sometimes causes a crash if you're using music.</p>
<p>⚫New glitch in v1 and above in PSP/PS1 cover download not working, all single downloads work fine except PSP with improper ID.</p>
<p>⚫Due to how the coding of the massive performance boost of v1.0.0+ is, some apps sometimes add garbage to the app title. A double scan on non-alphanumeric app titles might be able to fix this, or a better renaming function might work as a hotfix.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Planned Features for Upcoming Updates</h3>
<p>⚫Easier way to rename games</p>
<p>⚫Emu-launch, as seen in Retroflow. Either using Retroflow's rom identification, Adrenaline Bubble Manager's rom identification, and/or "MD5/CDC32 scraping" rom identification. Hopefully not slowing down loading times for people uninterested in Emu-launch.✔️Done but too buggy for release right now</p>
<p>⚫Ability to use Adrenaline Bubble Manager, Adrenaline Launcher, and Retroarch for PSP/PS1 where possible, all at once if you so feel like it. ✔️ framework for this - "pspemu_translation_table" is included in v0.9+ but Adrenaline Launcher capabilities are not added yet, only this framework.</p>
<p>⚫"Rolling Refresh" using a verification file that says 1: Current HexLauncher version, 2: # of entries in ux0:app folder and/or rom folders, 3: whether the last cache refresh was finished successfully. If any are untrue (ex: if you uninstall/install a new app), it will attempt a quick cache update - a "rolling refresh". ✔️Done but too buggy for release right now</p>
<p>⚫Categories: all Retroflow categories, Nintendo DS category (✔️ Done, coming when Retroflow integration is added to public HexLauncher Custom release), Android-YoYo Loader category, Dreamcast category (low priority but easy to program), ScummVM category (low priority), Playstation Mobile category (low priority), Pico8 category (low priority but easy to program), remote play category (low priority), RPGMaker category (low priority).</p>
<p>⚫Either new setting "Jump to last played game on startup: ON/OFF" or new startup category: "ALL - *JUMP TO LAST PLAYED*" ✔️Done, trying to decide which of the two ways it should be implemented. This will probably also be released alongside "Recently Played".</p>
<p>⚫PSVShell and the "L..." overclocking program integration. AKA the ability to launch an app at 500 overclock through triangle menu.✔️Done, coming when Retroflow integration is added to public HexLauncher Custom release</p>
<p>⚫Select opens up a sidebar similar to Vitashell's triangle menu, it will have "search" and little checkboxes to only show games of a certain genre ex: "Puzzles" and "Mario", with "Mario Picross" being in both. Inspired by "Dig - Emulator Front-End" for android. </p>
<p>⚫Absolute full translation for everything, including msg boxes (like retroflow)(easy but low priority)</p>
<p>⚫The option for playing gameboy original games in color. More than likely just a switch that messes with retroarch settings. This would be great for games that were retroactively given color such as Super Mario Land, Super Mario Land 2, QIX, Hyper Lode Runner, DrMario, Metroid 2, etc)(low priority and this will be hard to program).</p>
<p>⚫Extra smooth cover size adjusting, like the XBox "Aurora" coverflow app, you can see it at about 9 minute, 15 seconds into this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqvruf8q3J0 ✔️ There is a janky unreleased implementation of this, but it will probably be scrapped in favor of stealing the smooth scroll code from WiiFlow.</p>
<p>⚫Launchbox view, TN-X view, Wii view, and "List View" with a list of text of game names and maybe 1 cover?</p>
<p>⚫"Advanced options" button at the bottom so start menu can fit more settings?</p>
<p>⚫Setting for "livearea replacement mode: enables a loading screen image similar to the Enso "Molecule" image. Maybe have it set up autoboot for you, too? This will only be added if "advanced options" button is added. (easy)</p>
<p>⚫The ability to uninstall a game (via the triangle menu?). For now for that, you could technically use triangle menu to get app ID and delete it manually from ux0:app if you want. (easy, but this will only be added if "livearea replacement mode" is added)</p>
<p>⚫Setting to read from any rom location such as "ux0:Retroarch_Roms". This will only be added if "MD5/CDC32 scraping" rom identification is added.</p>
<p>⚫Setting to change between soundsets and background music (currently a hidden feature in VitaHEX's HexFlow Launcher v0.5 and all versions of HexLauncher Custom). May involve taking some code from Retroflow, which has more polished music code though still a hidden in that app too.</p>
<p>⚫Setting to change the category text color (on the top left of the screen) for when you're using a bright background (low priority)</p>
<p>⚫Setting to let you use the touchscreen to touch the "X Launch" on the bottom right of the screen to launch a game starting 1 second after you start HexLauncher Custom. (low priority). Any other touch features probably won't be added because when the screen gets wet it touches random places for you and also because I'm a lazy.</p>
<p>⚫Setting (or not as a setting just adding it normally?) to add categories/features: "recently played", "most played", "search", "all: sort by popularity", "all: sort by release date", and/or "favorites" ✔️Done (except sort by popularity/release date), coming when Retroflow integration is added to public HexLauncher Custom release</p>
<p>⚫Setting "Homebrew Style: <Default>/<Vita Cover-Style>/<Utility Split+50% Vita Coverstyle>/<Utility Split+100% Vita Coverstyle>". If you select any option, it will refresh cache. Vita style would put Vita game boxes on every homebrew, Utility Split 50% would put ports like "Bad Company 2" in Vita category (as if by overrides) and leave stuff like VitaShell in homebrews with homebrew cover styles, and Utility Split 100% would do the same as Utility Split 50% as well as it will put Vita game boxes on every homebrew. This would so the app would be able to make better use of the vita-style homebrew cover archive by reddit user "CoolFiverIsABabe".</p>
<p>⚫The ability to quickly add an app to "Custom" (through triangle menu?). High priority if "rolling refresh" is added.</p>
<p>⚫Setting to combine all PCEngine categories (or just have it combined by default, like psp and psp minis?). Setting to combine all gameboy categories. ✔️Done, coming when Retroflow integration is added to public HexLauncher Custom release</p>
<p>⚫Setting for multi-memory card users to scan roms from all memory cards. Note: running PSP games on secondary memory cards - uma0: - requires the special hacked version of adrenaline, and running vita games on secondary memory cards might not be possible. (low priority)</p>
<p>❌video/media category. Seems like an over-reach, just use MVPlayer.</p>
